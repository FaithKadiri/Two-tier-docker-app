# Two-tier Docker App

A hands-on lab for trying Docker networking using a simple two-tier application (frontend + backend) with Docker Compose.
Youâ€™ll build a working app, then break its networking (on purpose) to learn how to debug and fix issues like DNS failures, port conflicts, and misconfigurations.

# Project Overview
This project includes:
A Python Flask backend that returns "Hello from the backend!"
A frontend shell script that uses curl to call the backend
A docker-compose.yml to run both services
Built-in troubleshooting scenarios to simulate real-world network failures
